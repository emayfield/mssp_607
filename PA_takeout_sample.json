We really liked the fresh roll, spring rolls, dumplings, wild curry (good spice!), and basil chicken. They served healthy portions. Cash only & BYOB. We will definitely return!",

Seafood including Oysters were fresh and well prepared. Price was reasonable for \"Prefix\" menu including scrumptious dessert.  What an evening to end a fantastic summer day in Pittsburgh.",
